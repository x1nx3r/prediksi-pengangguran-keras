## Introduction
This project is a deep learning model designed to predict the Open Unemployment Rate (TPT) using historical data from 1987 to 2023. The model is built using the Keras library in Python, and the data is loaded from a CSV file. 

The data is first normalized using a custom function, and then split into training and testing sets. The model is a sequential model with three dense layers, using 'relu' activation function and a final layer with 'sigmoid' activation function. The model is trained for 500 epochs, and the mean squared error is used as the loss function.

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results are visualized using matplotlib to plot the actual vs predicted values and the prediction errors.

Finally, the model is used to predict the Open Unemployment Rate for the years 2022 and 2023. The predicted values are then denormalized and compared with the actual values. The performance of the model on this test data is also evaluated using the same metrics as before.

## Prerequisites

### Python Version
Ensure you have Python version `3.9.13` installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To manage python version you can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) if you're on Linux or [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) if you're on Windows.

Another thing worth in managing python versions in Windows is that you can install multiple interpreter into the same path and then configure what version to use manually using vscode interpreter setting and set-up a venv from there too. If you are already doing this then it's fine not to use pyenv-win. If you're not then i won't write the tutorial here considering how lengthy it will be.

To check your Python version, run:
``` sh
python --version
```

### Module Requirements
To run this project you need some modules with specific version :
```sh
Tensorflow version : 2.16.1
Keras version : 2.16.0
Numpy version 1.26.4
Matplotlib version 3.8.4
Scikit-learn version 1.4.2
```
It is advised to insstall these specific version as to save you and me some headache. Thankfully i have included an `init.py` file to make it easier to install these modules.

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository
Clone this repository in whenever directory you desire by running the command :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/x1nx3r/prediksi-pengangguran-keras.git
```
### Setting Up Virtual Environment
It is strongly advised to use a virtual environment in this project considering the specific requirements of python and modules versions to save you from the infamous dependency hell. But if you prefer to use global interpreter you can skip this step.

To start setting up your virtual environment you can do :
#### On Windows :
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### On Linux :
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages using:
```sh
python init.py
```
This will checks for your python interpreter version and whether you have a virtual environment set-up, then installs the required dependency from the `requirements.txt`

## Usage
To run this project you can either use `VSCode` or the vanilla `Jupyter Notebook`
### Using VSCode
If you haven't set-up your VSCode for python development then you have to set it up first to be able to run and debug `Python`

To setup your python development environment in vscode you can refer to  [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) from the VSCode official docs and [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) to setup Jupyter Notebook in python.

After having a working python development environment you can then install the `Jupyter Notebook` extension from the Extension Marketplace.

After setting up everything you can just simply open this project folder as a project in VSCode an run the `Prediksi_Pengangguran_2023.ipnyb`

### Using Vanilla Jupyter Notebook
To use the vanilla Jupyter Notebook for this project all you need to do is to run this command in the project directory :
```
jupyter notebook
```
